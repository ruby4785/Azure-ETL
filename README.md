Project Title: Supermarket Sales Optimization Using Azure Data Services

Problem Identification: Identified the need to optimize sales and profitability for a supermarket chain by leveraging data-driven insights.

Solution Development: Developed a robust data processing pipeline using Azure Data Services. This included:

Ingesting 10,000 data points from the superstore into Azure Data Lake Gen2 storage using Azure Data Factory for efficient data ingestion and storage.
Transforming and analyzing the data using PySpark in Azure Databricks, a powerful distributed computing environment.
Conducting in-depth analysis in Azure Synapse Analytics using Python to calculate sales and profit metrics and identify key factors influencing sales (e.g., discount ranges, shipping methods, product categories across different states).
Impact: The analysis provided valuable insights into lucrative product categories and sales strategies tailored to specific regions, resulting in:

Improved sales performance and profitability metrics.
Enhanced understanding of factors driving sales across different regions.
Visualization and Communication: Designed an intuitive and visually appealing dashboard using Power BI to:
